# Teams & Org — Operations

Running `observer-org` day to day: backup/restore, key rotation, upgrades, and
troubleshooting. See [teams-getting-started.md](teams-getting-started.md) to
install and [teams-architecture.md](teams-architecture.md) for how it works.

---

## 1. What state exists

| State | Location | Backup priority |
|---|---|---|
| Server database | `/var/lib/observer-org/server.db` (+ `-wal`, `-shm`) | **Critical** — all org/identity/audit data |
| Config | `/etc/observer-org/config.toml` | Low (reproducible) |
| Bearer signing key | `bearer-signing.key` | **Critical** — losing it invalidates every agent bearer |
| Session HMAC key | `session.key` | Low (rotating just logs everyone out) |
| SAML SP cert/key | `sp.crt` / `sp.key` | Medium (rotation needs IdP re-trust) |
| SCIM token | `scim-token` | Medium (rotation needs IdP update) |

The server uses SQLite in WAL mode (pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGO).

---

## 2. Backup and restore

### Backup (online, consistent)

Use SQLite's online backup so you capture a consistent snapshot even while the
server is running:

```bash
# Docker:
docker exec observer-org sh -c \
  'sqlite3 /var/lib/observer-org/server.db ".backup /var/lib/observer-org/backup.db"' \
  || true   # distroless has no shell — see the volume-copy fallback below
```

The distroless image has no shell, so prefer one of:

- **Stop-and-copy** (brief downtime): `docker stop observer-org`, copy
  `/var/lib/observer-org/server.db*` (all three files) from the volume, then
  start again.
- **Volume snapshot**: snapshot the underlying PV/volume. With WAL mode, copy
  `server.db`, `server.db-wal`, and `server.db-shm` together.
- **Sidecar**: run a small `sqlite3`-equipped sidecar mounting the same volume
  read-only and run `.backup`.

On Kubernetes, snapshot the PVC (VolumeSnapshot) or run a backup CronJob with a
sidecar that mounts the claim.

### Restore

1. Stop the server.
2. Replace `/var/lib/observer-org/server.db` with the backup (remove stale
   `-wal`/`-shm` if restoring a `.backup` output, which is already
   checkpointed).
3. Ensure ownership is `65532:65532`.
4. Start the server and run `observer-org migrate --config ...` — it reports
   the schema version and applies any pending migrations idempotently.

Agents keep working across a restore: their cursors are local, and re-pushes
are deduped on composite keys, so a restored-slightly-stale DB self-heals on
the next push cycle.

---

## 3. Key rotation

### Session HMAC key (`session.key`)

Lowest-stakes. Replace the file and restart. Effect: all dashboard sessions are
invalidated; users re-authenticate via SAML on next visit. No data impact.

### SCIM token (`scim-token`)

1. Generate a new token (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
2. Update the IdP's SCIM client with the new token.
3. Replace the file and restart.
   Sequence the IdP update close to the restart to minimise the window where
   provisioning calls `401`.

### SAML SP cert/key (`sp.crt` / `sp.key`)

1. Generate a new keypair.
2. Re-upload the SP metadata / cert to the IdP so it trusts the new signing
   cert.
3. Replace the files and restart.
   Until the IdP trusts the new cert, signed AuthnRequests are rejected — do
   this in a maintenance window.

### Bearer signing key (`bearer-signing.key`) — disruptive

This key signs **every** agent bearer. Rotating it invalidates all existing
bearers: every enrolled agent must **re-enrol** (`observer enroll` with a fresh
token). Rotate only on suspected compromise. Procedure: replace the key,
restart, then re-issue enrolment tokens and have developers re-enrol. Prefer
**revoking individual bearers** (below) over rotating the signing key.

### Revoking a single agent

From the dashboard (admin → bearers) or by recording the bearer's `jti` in
`revoked_bearers`. `VerifyBearer` checks the revocation list on every push, so
a revoked agent's next push gets `401`. This does not require rotating the
signing key or disturbing other agents.

---

## 4. Upgrades

Agent and server ship at the **same semver tag**; compatibility is "matching
minor". Upgrade the server first, then agents, within the same minor.

**v1.7.x → v1.8.x note.** The 2026-06-03 release introduced the new
privacy posture (hashes ship by default; raws gated behind a per-node
TOML opt-in). Both directions of the upgrade are forward-compatible:

- v1.7.x agent → v1.8.x server: ingest computes the missing
  `*_hash` columns server-side from the raw values the old agent ships
  (`internal/orgserver/ingest/ingest.go::hashOrComputed`). Rows land
  with both shapes populated and rollups continue to work. After all
  agents have upgraded, run `observer-org scrub-content --all --confirm`
  to purge the now-redundant raw columns (the hash counterparts are
  preserved; rollup queries that keyed on the raws are already migrated
  in v1.8.x).
- v1.8.x agent → v1.7.x server: the new `*_hash` JSON keys are
  additive and ignored by the older schema. The `omitempty` raw
  columns ship empty in metadata-only mode, which the v1.7.x server
  accepts. Rollups still work; the server just doesn't have the
  hashes to dedup against.

```bash
# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/marmutapp/observer-org:v1.7.2
# verify the signature before rolling
cosign verify ghcr.io/marmutapp/observer-org:v1.7.2 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer-private/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
docker stop observer-org && docker rm observer-org && docker run ... :v1.7.2

# Helm
helm upgrade observer-org charts/observer-org -n observer-org \
  --reuse-values --set image.tag=v1.7.2
```

Migrations run automatically on `serve` startup (and can be applied explicitly
with `observer-org migrate`). **Back up the DB before any upgrade** that may
carry a migration. The Helm chart uses a `Recreate` rollout so the old pod
releases the `ReadWriteOnce` volume before the new one binds it.

Supply-chain artefacts attached to each release: per-binary CycloneDX SBOMs
(`observer.cdx.json` / `observer-org.cdx.json`), SLSA Level 3 provenance
(`multiple.intoto.jsonl`), and the cosign-signed image. To verify the provenance
of a downloaded binary, use **slsa-verifier v2.7.0 or newer** (older versions
fail with `unexpected tlog entry type … got dsse:0.0.1`) and pass the private
origin repo as the source — the build runs there:

```bash
slsa-verifier verify-artifact ./observer-org \
  --provenance-path multiple.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer-private
```

### Scrubbing pre-v1.8.0 leaked content (one-time)

If your server ran v1.7.x agents before the v1.8.0 cutover, the
`actions.target` / `source_file` / `project_root` / `git_remote` /
`token_usage.source_file` columns hold raw command bodies, assistant
prose, and filesystem paths from those earlier pushes. The v1.8.x
server logs a startup WARN naming each affected column. To purge:

```bash
# Dry-run first — prints per-column row counts and exits.
docker exec observer-org observer-org scrub-content \
  --config /etc/observer-org/config.toml --all

# Apply (writes a .scrubbed-<ts>.bak alongside the DB first).
docker exec observer-org observer-org scrub-content \
  --config /etc/observer-org/config.toml --all --confirm
```

The `*_hash` counterparts are preserved, so dedup keys + rollup
queries continue to work. Per-column flags (`--actions-target`,
`--sessions-git-remote`, etc.) let you scrub a subset instead of
`--all`. `--skip-backup` is available for installations with an
external backup pipeline.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### `observer-org doctor`

Run the built-in health check first — it validates config, DB access, secret
file presence/permissions, and reports the schema version:

```bash
docker exec observer-org observer-org doctor --config /etc/observer-org/config.toml
# or: kubectl exec deploy/observer-org -- observer-org doctor --config ...
```

### Server won't start

- **`fetch IdP metadata from ... failed`** — `saml.idp_metadata_url` is
  unreachable from the pod, or wrong. The server fetches it eagerly at startup.
  Fix the URL/network and restart.
- **`unable to open database file` / SQLITE_CANTOPEN** — the data volume is not
  writable by uid 65532. Ensure `/var/lib/observer-org` is owned `65532:65532`
  (Docker) or that the Helm `fsGroup: 65532` is in effect (it is by default).
- **Secret read errors** — the mounted secret files must be readable by uid
  65532; the SCIM token must be `0600` or `doctor` flags it.

### SAML login fails

- **Clock skew** — SAML assertions are time-bounded. If the IdP and server
  clocks differ by more than the tolerance, logins fail with an assertion
  validity error. Ensure NTP on both sides; skew is the most common cause.
- **Attribute mapping** — if the dashboard shows a user with no email/teams,
  the IdP isn't emitting the attributes named in `saml.attribute_mapping`.
  Inspect the assertion and align the mapping.
- **Audience/ACS mismatch** — the IdP's Audience must equal
  `saml.sp_entity_id` and its ACS must be `<external_url>/saml/acs`.

### SCIM returns 4xx

- **`401`** — wrong SCIM bearer token; the IdP's configured token doesn't match
  `scim-token`. Re-sync after a rotation.
- **`409` on create** — the user/group already exists (idempotent provisioning
  re-run); usually benign.
- **`404` on patch/delete** — the IdP references a resource id the server
  doesn't have (provisioning drift); a full re-sync from the IdP reconciles it.

### Agent pushes fail

- **`401` with a stale-timestamp error** — agent and server clocks differ by
  more than ±300s. Fix NTP on the agent host.
- **`401` after working before** — the bearer was revoked, or the bearer
  signing key was rotated. The developer must re-enrol with a fresh token.
- **persistent `5xx`/network** — the agent backs off and retries; it never
  blocks local use. Check `observer org status` for the last error and the
  server logs for the corresponding request id.

### Dashboard shows nothing

- You are not in `dashboard.admin_emails` and are not a team lead. Members see
  nothing by design. Add your email to `admin_emails` and restart, or have an
  admin assign you a lead role via SCIM group membership.

## 5b. Guard rollups, RBAC and dashboard policy authoring (v1.8.3 / G14)

Agents with the guard layer enabled push content-free guard-event rows
(rule id, category, severity, decision, enforced, hashes, chain links —
see guard spec §10.2); the server lands them in `guard_events` and the
dashboard's **Security** page rolls them up: verdict trends, rule-hit
leaderboards, per-team posture, and per-agent audit-chain continuity.
The chain report is a per-developer disclosure and is **audited** like
the cost drill-down (`view_guard_agents` rows in the audit log).

Two new `[dashboard]` config email lists layer the §14.5 roles onto the
existing admin/lead model (an admin implicitly holds both):

```toml
[dashboard]
admin_emails           = ["ops@acme.example"]
policy_admin_emails    = ["seceng@acme.example"]   # author/publish bundles + org-wide guard reads
security_viewer_emails = ["audit@acme.example"]    # org-wide guard reads, no policy write
```

Team leads see their teams' guard slice; plain members see nothing.

The **Policy** page shows the bundle version history and, for a
`policy_admin`, authors new versions through the same lint+sign+insert
gate as `observer-org policy publish` (each publish is audit-logged as
`publish_policy_bundle`). Dashboard publishing requires
`[policy].signing_key_path`; the server loads the key per publish and
retains nothing between requests. Operators who prefer the CLI-only
signing posture (the v1.8.3/G13 default) simply leave
`policy_admin_emails` empty — the authoring panel then refuses every
publish.

---

## 6. Data retention

`server.data_retention_days` (default 730) bounds how long pushed org data is
kept server-side. Deprovisioning a user via SCIM removes their access
immediately; their historical rows age out under the retention policy.
