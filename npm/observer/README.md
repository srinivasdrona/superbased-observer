## Install

**Use a global install** (`-g`) so the `observer` command is available
on your `$PATH` from any directory:

```bash
npm install -g @superbased/observer
observer --version
```

If you install locally (without `-g`) the binary lives at
`./node_modules/.bin/observer` and isn't on your `$PATH`. Run it
with `npx`:

```bash
npm install @superbased/observer    # local install
npx observer --version              # ↑ what to use everywhere `observer` is shown below
```

A note for shared / CI machines where `npm install -g` may need
`sudo`: see [Troubleshooting → EACCES](#npm-install--g-fails-with-eacces-permission-denied)
for user-writable-prefix and version-manager fixes.

> **Python users:** `pip install superbased-observer` ships the
> same binary; version numbers are kept in lock-step. See
> [the PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/superbased-observer/).
> Don't install both globally — whichever directory comes first on
> `$PATH` wins, which gets confusing if their versions drift.

Pre-built binaries ship for:

| Platform              | Architecture |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Linux                 | x64, arm64   |
| macOS (Intel)         | x64          |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | arm64        |
| Windows               | x64          |

The package uses the `optionalDependencies`-per-platform pattern (same
shape as `esbuild` / `swc` / `@biomejs/biome`) — only the binary
matching your machine downloads. No postinstall network calls, no
compile step.

If your platform isn't listed, build from source — instructions in
the [main repo](https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer).


## Five-minute quickstart

```bash
# 1) Install.
npm install -g @superbased/observer

# 2) Start everything: proxy + watcher + dashboard in one process.
#    Hooks auto-register for every detected AI tool, and the
#    dashboard opens in your browser (suppress with --no-open).
observer start
```

From here the dashboard drives:

3. **Route your AI client through the proxy** — on the Compression
   tab's **Proxy** banner, click your tool's status pill, then
   **Route through the observer proxy…**. The button previews the
   exact file change and writes only on confirm. (Every other
   routing mechanism — `observer init`, the `observer claude` /
   `observer codex` wrappers, plain env vars — is listed in
   [Per-AI-client setup](#per-ai-client-setup).)
4. **Use your AI tool as normal.** The Overview tab's onboarding
   checklist tracks your first captured session; cost, compression,
   and cache numbers populate within minutes of real activity.

`observer init` is OPTIONAL — run it only if you want the MCP server
registered with your AI clients (gives them on-demand tools like
`check_file_freshness` / `get_cost_summary`, at the cost of ~1,800
tokens of schema per turn). Skip it for an MCP-free install.

**What `start` does vs what `init` adds:**

| Step | Hooks | Proxy listening | Watcher | Dashboard | MCP in AI clients | Codex proxy route |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `observer start` alone | auto-registers ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| `observer init` + `observer start` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `observer init --skip-mcp` + `start` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |

MCP and codex routing are explicit-only because both write per-client
config files. Hooks self-heal on every `start`.


## Per-AI-client setup

### Routing through the proxy — the canonical section

Accurate token counts, conversation compression, and cache tracking
all require your AI client to send its API traffic through the local
proxy on `127.0.0.1:8820`. There is one decision to make — *how* to
route — and four mechanisms that all end at the same proxy. Pick the
first one that fits:

| Mechanism | What it does | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard button** *(recommended)* | On the Compression tab's **Proxy** banner, click your tool's status pill, then **Route through the observer proxy…**. It previews the exact file change and writes only on confirm: Claude Code gets `"env": { "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": … }` in `~/.claude/settings.json`; Codex gets an `observer` model provider in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Durable — every later session routes automatically, no wrapper, no env vars. Undo: remove the entry, or `observer uninstall --claude-code` / `--codex`. | You have a browser open. This is the default path. |
| **`observer init`** | Writes the same durable routing from the CLI, alongside hooks + MCP registration (each side defaults on; opt out with `--skip-hooks` / `--skip-mcp` / `--skip-proxy-route`). | Headless machines, scripted setups. |
| **Wrapper commands** — `observer claude` / `observer codex` | Launch the tool with routing injected for that session only; nothing is written to any config file. The claude wrapper also re-exports a fresh Pro/Max OAuth token so the SDK's OAuth path can't bypass the proxy (an expired stored token is left alone — Claude Code then refreshes natively). `observer claude --verify` runs the pre-flight checks without launching. | Trying the proxy out, or you don't want config writes. |
| **Env var export** | `export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820` (Anthropic clients) or `export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820/v1` (OpenAI clients — note the `/v1`) in the shell that launches the tool. | One-off shells; clients without a button or wrapper. |

Routing is per-tool, not global: route Claude Code and Codex
independently, and both can coexist on one machine — the proxy
routes by URL path.

> **Claude Code + MCP servers**: set `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` in the
> same environment. Claude Code's SDK disables deferred MCP schema
> loading whenever `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set and eager-inlines every
> registered MCP schema (~+21K tokens/turn) — enough to turn the proxy
> into a net cost. The override restores lazy loading; the proxy
> forwards `tool_reference` blocks byte-identically.

> **If the daemon is down while a tool is routed**, Claude Code does
> not silently bypass to the real API — it retries the dead port
> (verified live: it hangs rather than failing over). `observer
> doctor` and the dashboard's Health panel flag this state as a
> "proxy routing gap"; bring the daemon back with `observer start`.

### Capture modes per client

The proxy covers the clients that speak the Anthropic / OpenAI wire
APIs. Everything else is captured passively from session logs. The
table below is the full per-client reference.

| AI client                       | Env var                                               | Capture mode |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Claude Code**                 | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820`            | proxy + JSONL |
| **Cursor** (Anthropic mode)     | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820`            | proxy + JSONL |
| **Codex**                       | `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820/v1` (note `/v1`) | proxy + JSONL with API-key auth; ChatGPT-plan login currently behaves as JSONL only |
| **Cursor** (OpenAI mode)        | `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820/v1`            | proxy + JSONL |
| **Cline (VS Code) / Roo Code**  | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=...` or `OPENAI_BASE_URL=...` per provider | proxy + JSONL |
| **Cline CLI** (npm `cline` 3.0.20+) | (no proxy route yet — the CLI ignores base-URL env vars; per-provider `baseUrl` overrides live in `~/.cline/data/settings/providers.json`, a credentials file only the operator should edit) | JSONL — SQLite session metadata at `~/.cline/data/db/sessions.db` (schema v1, 28 columns) plus per-session `<id>.messages.json` content blocks. Captures `user_prompt` / `assistant_text` / `tool_use` / paired `tool_result` rows + Tier 2 per-API-call token usage from `modelInfo` overrides. Subagent + team linkage via 5 new `ActionMetadata` fields (`ParentSessionID`, `ParentAgentID`, `AgentID`, `IsSubagent`, `TeamName`). 28-tool taxonomy (10 core + 18 `team_*` coordination primitives). WSL2 over `/mnt/c` uses the same `stageMirror` pattern as opencode/kilocode. Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **GitHub Copilot**              | (no proxy yet)                                        | JSONL only   |
| **OpenCode** ([opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai/)) | (no proxy yet)                     | SQLite — actual install path is `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (XDG). Captures **token counts + model + cost** per assistant message from OpenCode's InfoData (`tokens.input/output/reasoning/cache.{read,write}` + `cost`); **subtask** parts → `spawn_subagent` actions; **todo** table → `todo_update` actions; tool-name coverage extended to webfetch/websearch/task/todowrite/todoread/multiedit. Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **OpenClaw** ([openclaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai/)) | (no proxy yet)                     | JSONL + sqlite — `~/.openclaw/tasks/runs.sqlite` + `~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/sessions/sessions.json` |
| **Pi** ([pi.dev](https://pi.dev/)) | (no proxy yet)                                       | JSONL — `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<path>--/*.jsonl` (per upstream `docs/session-format.md` v3). Captures user / assistant / toolResult / `bashExecution` message roles; `usage.cost.total` → per-message USD; terminal `stopReason` (stop/length/error/aborted) → `task_complete` with `success=false` for failures (mid-turn `toolUse` is correctly skipped); `thinking` blocks surface as preceding reasoning. Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **Google Antigravity** | (no proxy yet) | Encrypted protobuf — `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/*.pb` (Linux-native) and the matching Windows-side path on WSL2. Observer ships a per-OS Chromium-pattern `oscrypt` key fetcher (macOS Keychain / libsecret / DPAPI / WSL2-via-PowerShell helper) and a multi-cipher try-loop for local decryption. Sessions whose ciphers don't validate locally fall back to the language_server's `GetCascadeTrajectory` gRPC endpoint via a built-in helper (`antigravity-bridge.exe` on WSL2 / native gRPC elsewhere) — extracts model + per-turn token counts + Tier 0–6 ToolEvents (file views, artifact edits/writes, user prompts, assistant text, run_command terminal snapshots, structured plan steps, final summaries). State index + per-conversation title/workspace URI read from `state.vscdb` + `state.vscdb.backup`. Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **Kilo Code IDE extension (legacy)** | (no proxy yet) | JSON — `<vsCodeGlobalStorage>/kilocode.kilo-code/tasks/<taskId>/api_conversation_history.json`. The legacy Kilo extension is a Cline + Roo Code fork and shares the Cline parser; emitted rows are re-tagged `Tool="kilo-code"` so dashboard rollups don't blur Kilo activity into Cline. Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **Kilo Code CLI (current)**     | (no proxy route yet — base-URL env vars are not honored; a project-scoped `kilo.json` provider `baseURL` override reaches the proxy, but the Gateway provider's model-catalog calls share that base URL and have no upstream there — see `docs/kilo-code-adapter.md`) | SQLite — `~/.local/share/kilo/kilo.db` on every OS (Kilo intentionally mirrors XDG; Windows does NOT use `%APPDATA%`). The new `@kilocode/cli` (npm) is a fork of sst/opencode and uses the same `message`/`part`/`todo` tables shape with Kilo additions (`project`, `workspace`, `event`, `session_message`, `account`, `permission`, `session_share`). Captures **token counts + model + cost** per assistant message from `message.data.tokens = {total, input, output, reasoning, cache: {read, write}}`. Tool name coverage inherits OpenCode's surface (`read` → `read_file`, `bash` → `run_command`, `websearch` → `web_search`, etc.). Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **Gemini CLI** | (no proxy yet) | JSONL or single-object JSON — `~/.gemini/tmp/<hash>/chats/session-*.{json,jsonl}`. Dual-format dispatch: legacy single-object JSON (size-based cursor, cline-style) and proposed JSONL event records (byte-offset cursor, issue [#15292](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/15292)). Action mapping covers `read_file` / `write_file` / `edit_file` / `run_command` / `search_files` / `web_fetch` and arbitrary MCP tool calls. Project root falls back through tool-call `cwd` → `~/.gemini/history/<hash>/.git/config` worktree pointer → synthetic `[gemini-cli:<hash>]` key (promoted via ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE on `sessions.project_id` once a future scan supplies a real cwd). Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |
| **Hermes Agent** ([Nous Research](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)) | (provider-routed; uses your existing `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` when set) | Hooks + SQLite — Python plugin at `~/.hermes/plugins/superbased-observer/` registers `post_tool_call` / `post_api_request` / `on_session_start` / `on_session_end` / `subagent_stop` callbacks (fire-and-forget via `observer hook hermes`); the watcher walks `~/.hermes/state.db` (schema v14, `messages.active = 1` filter) and emits `ToolEvent` + `TokenEvent` rows via `modernc.org/sqlite`. 70+ Hermes tools fold into the normalized action set (`read_file` / `write_file` / `patch` / `terminal` / `search_files` / `web_search` / `web_extract` / `browser_*` / `delegate_task` / `todo` / `clarify` / `memory` + `mcp_call` fall-through). Token bundles lifted from `post_api_request.usage{input/output/cache/reasoning_tokens}`; OpenRouter `:suffix` tails (`:free`, `:beta`, `:fast`) preserved so the dashboard distinguishes paid vs free tiers. Install via `observer init --hermes`; backfill via `observer backfill --hermes-rescan`. Tagged `Source=jsonl, Reliability=approximate`. |

**JSONL-only** clients are captured passively by the watcher whenever
`observer start` is running. Hooks self-heal on every `start`, so a
fresh install captures the JSONL side without any `init` step. You won't see real-time cost numbers
for them on the Compression tab (those need the proxy), but every tool
call shows up on Sessions / Actions / Discovery / Tools / Patterns and
the JSONL-derived token counts feed the Cost tab. Reliability tagging
is per-adapter: Claude Code emits `unreliable` (the JSONL stream uses
streaming-time placeholder counts per spec §24); Codex / Cline / Cline CLI /
Pi / OpenCode / OpenClaw / Antigravity / Gemini CLI / Hermes / Kilo Code / Kilo Code CLI emit `approximate`
(provider-reported usage that hasn't been reconciled against an
upstream invoice).

For **Codex specifically**, Observer currently has two practical support modes:

- `Proxy + JSONL`: Codex is routed through `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820/v1` and Observer can link proxy turns to the session, so live compression metrics are available.
- `JSONL only`: Observer can still recover sessions, actions, and approximate token counts from `~/.codex/sessions`, but live proxy compression is currently not available when Codex is logged in with a ChatGPT plan on the local machine.

## Architecture in detail

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/infographics/intelligence-across-tools.png" alt="Shared local intelligence layer across tools" width="780">
</p>

Five components running side by side:

### 1. JSONL adapters (passive ingest)

Watch `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.codex/sessions/`,
`~/.gemini/tmp/.../chats/`, `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/`
(and the matching Antigravity index `state.vscdb`), etc. for new
session log lines. Normalize per-client tool names to a shared
taxonomy (`read_file`, `run_command`, `spawn_subagent`, …) and write
them into the actions table. Active whenever `observer start` is
running; hooks self-heal on each start so no separate `init` step is
required for capture.

For Antigravity (which stores conversations as encrypted protobufs),
observer ships a per-OS `oscrypt` key fetcher (Chromium Safe Storage
pattern: macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret + peanuts fallback / Windows
DPAPI / WSL2-via-PowerShell helper) plus a `language_server`-aware
gRPC fallback that calls `GetCascadeTrajectory` through the bundled
`antigravity-bridge.exe` when local decryption can't validate the
ciphertext. Tier 0–6 ToolEvents (file views, artifact edits/writes,
user prompts, assistant text, run_command terminal snapshots,
structured plan steps, final summaries) are extracted from the
trajectory's wire format without committing to specific .proto field
numbers.

What this gets you: every tool call you've ever run, queryable.

### 2. API reverse proxy (active capture)

A localhost HTTP server (`127.0.0.1:8820`) you point your AI client
at via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. Intercepts every
request before it hits Anthropic / OpenAI and:

- Records exact token usage from the upstream `usage` envelope (the
  most accurate cost source — proxy beats JSONL parsing here).
- Runs the **conversation compression pipeline** to trim large
  `tool_result` blocks and drop low-importance messages before
  forwarding upstream.
- Captures the `cost_usd` the upstream reports (when present).

What this gets you: ground-truth cost numbers and conversation
compression savings you can measure.

### 3. SQLite store

A single file at `~/.observer/observer.db`. Tables include:

- `projects`, `sessions`, `actions` — the taxonomy
- `api_turns` — one row per proxy-intercepted upstream request
- `token_usage` — JSONL-derived token-row events (deduped via spec §A1)
- `file_state` — content hashes for freshness classification
- `compression_events` — per-event compression detail (post-migration 010)
- `project_patterns` — derived patterns from `observer patterns`
- `failure_context`, `action_excerpts` — diagnostic data

Pure-Go via `modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGO. WAL mode by default.

### 4. Local dashboard (`:8081`)

Fifteen tabs in four groups — Monitor (Overview, Live, Sessions,
Actions, Search), Analyze (Cost, Analysis, Tools), Optimize
(Compression, Cache, Suggestions, Discovery, Patterns), Configure
(Privacy, Settings). See [Dashboard tour](#dashboard-tour).

Static HTML + Chart.js. No analytics, no external requests.

### 5. MCP server (stdio) — opt-in via `observer init`

13 read-only tools the AI client itself can call mid-conversation —
`check_file_freshness`, `get_last_test_result`, `search_past_outputs`,
etc. (plus `retrieve_stashed` when the proxy stash is configured).
Powers cross-client tool sharing: if Claude Code ran `go test`,
Cursor's MCP query for the latest test result will return Claude
Code's run. See [MCP tools reference](#mcp-tools-reference).

**Lifecycle**: the MCP server is a stdio subprocess spawned by your
AI tool — not by the observer daemon. It's registered into each AI
client's MCP config only when you run `observer init`. `observer
start` alone does NOT register the MCP server. Adds roughly 1,800
tokens of tool-schema overhead per AI-client turn; opt out with
`observer init --skip-mcp` (registers hooks only) or by simply not
running `init`.


## Dashboard tour

`observer start` opens the dashboard automatically on interactive
launches (suppress with `--no-open`; the URL is also printed —
`http://127.0.0.1:8081/` by default). Fifteen tabs in four nav groups
(Monitor / Analyze / Optimize / Configure) — the tour below covers the
core surfaces; Live (recent sessions with a real-time action feed),
Search (full-text over captured tool outputs), and Privacy (capture
map + scrub tester) are self-explanatory once you're in. On an empty
database the Overview tab leads with a three-step onboarding
checklist that takes you from zero to your first captured session
without leaving the browser.

**Just looking?** The empty-database Overview also offers **demo
mode**: one click seeds a temporary synthetic dataset so every chart
and table renders with realistic data — parsed through the real
ingest pipeline into a temp DB; your real `observer.db` is never read
or written. A persistent banner marks demo state, and one click
clears it again. The fastest way to evaluate the dashboard before
routing any real traffic.

### Overview tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/01-overview.png" alt="Overview tab" width="900">
</p>

High-level snapshot of the selected window:

- **KPI tiles**: Sessions count, API turns (proxy-captured), Token
  rows (JSONL-recovered), Failures (24h)
- **Cost over time** chart — daily token volume, split into the four
  billable buckets (net input / cache read / cache write / output)
- **Actions over time** chart — total actions vs failures
- **Top models (by tokens)** chart — top-8 models stacked by net
  input / cache read / output
- **Top tools (actions over time)** — per-AI-client stacked-area
  showing when each client is active

### Cost tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/04-cost.png" alt="Cost tab" width="900">
</p>

Per-model breakdown over the selected window. Tokens split into the
four billing buckets, with computed dollar cost and a reliability
flag. Cost is always computed locally as `tokens × pricing_table[model]`
— neither Anthropic nor OpenAI returns cost in their API responses, so
the proxy can't capture upstream-billed cost. Reliability values:
`accurate` (proxy-captured tokens, exact rate), `approximate` (JSONL-
sourced tokens, rate may be a family-prefix fallback), `unreliable`
(Claude Code JSONL streaming placeholders, ~10% off output), `unknown`
(no pricing entry for the model). Two adapters — OpenCode and Pi —
write their own per-turn cost into `estimated_cost_usd`; the engine
uses those as-is when present.

in the help drawer.

### Analysis tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/05-analysis.png" alt="Analysis tab" width="900">
</p>

Spending insights for the selected window. Twelve headline KPI
tiles comparing this period to prior: spend Δ%, MTD vs budget with
projection bar, $/M output rate, cache savings + cache efficacy %,
high-context turn count, $/turn, burn rate ($/active hour), top
model concentration %, Discovery waste $, sessions total. Below
the tiles: a daily-spend stacked bar with Model / Project / Tool
dimension toggle, hour-of-day heatmap, top-12 expensive sessions
with explanatory badges (`opus`, `lc_tier`, `many_turns`,
`large_prompt`), period-over-period movers (top increases / decreases
/ new entrants), and routing-efficiency suggestions (trivial Opus
sessions that could have used Sonnet).

### Sessions tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/02-sessions.png" alt="Sessions tab" width="900">
</p>

One row per AI-coding session. Each session has a stable ID, a tool
(claude-code / cursor / codex / cline / cline-cli / copilot / copilot-cli /
opencode / openclaw / pi / antigravity / gemini-cli / hermes /
kilo-code / kilo-code-cli), a working-directory project, action
count, sub-agent action count (when the session spawned sub-agents via
the `Agent` tool), per-session **Tokens** and **Cost** columns, and —
if `observer score` has run — quality / errors / redundancy ratios. The `~` suffix on Cost flags rows whose pricing
was tier-fallback rather than billing-grade ("accurate" reliability).

Click a row to open the session-detail panel:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/11-session-detail.png" alt="Session detail slide-over" width="900">
</p>


- **Top tiles** — Tool, Started, Actions count (ok/fail), Cost.
- **Action breakdown** — chart of action_type counts.
- **Tokens** — the four billing buckets (Net Input / Cache Read /
  Cache Write / Output) for the whole session, per-turn-deduped
  (proxy preferred, JSONL fills gaps).
- **Per-model breakdown** — when a session uses multiple models
  (Claude Code's main + sub-agent dispatches always do), a row per
  model with its tokens and cost.
- **Messages** — per-message timeline keyed on the upstream
  Anthropic `msg_xxx`. Each row shows the message id, role, model,
  the message's own token bucket, cost, and a `N ▾` pill that
  expands inline to show the contained tool calls. Toggle radio at
  the top: **Tool messages only** (default — assistant turns with
  ≥1 tool call + user prompts) vs **All messages** (also pure-text
  assistant replies). Truncated IDs (session_id, message_id)
  show a dotted underline on hover and copy the full value to
  clipboard on click; truncated text fields (target, error message)
  click to expand in-place. Server-side paginated at 50/100/200
  messages per page (selectable in the panel footer) — keeps the
  browser responsive on multi-thousand-message sessions. Requires
  `observer backfill --message-id` on first upgrade for historical
  sessions to surface their parent message ids.

### Actions tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/03-actions.png" alt="Actions tab" width="900">
</p>

The flat firehose: every recorded tool call, normalized across

### Tools tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/06-tools.png" alt="Tools tab" width="900">
</p>

Per-AI-client (the *client* — claude-code / cursor / codex / etc., not
the per-tool name) aggregates plus three views:

- **KPI tiles**: Total actions, Distinct tools, Overall success rate,
  Busiest tool
- **Activity over time** stacked-area showing per-tool action volume
  per day
- **Action-type mix per tool** horizontal stacked bar — what each
  tool actually does (read_file vs edit_file vs run_command vs
  search_text vs spawn_subagent)
- The full per-tool aggregate table with first/last seen

### Compression tab

  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/07-compression.png" alt="Compression tab" width="900">
</p>

How many tokens and dollars the conversation-compression pipeline
saved by trimming requests before forwarding upstream:

- **KPI tiles**: Tokens saved (est.), Dollars saved (est.), Bytes
  saved, Turns compressed
- **Savings per day** chart — daily tokens-saved (left axis) and
  bytes-saved (right axis)
- **Savings by mechanism** stacked bar — segments per mechanism
  (json / code / logs / text / diff / html / drop). **Toggle the
  y-axis between tokens and bytes** with the chart-header switch.
- **Per-model breakdown table** — tokens saved ~, $ saved ~, bytes
  saved, saved %, turns, tool-results compressed, dropped, markers
- **Recent compression events** — paginated per-event detail with
  mechanism, original / compressed / saved bytes, message slot, importance
  score (for drops), and a **Source** column showing whether the
  event came from a main-thread or sub-agent runtime call

### Cache tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/08-cache.png" alt="Cache tab" width="900">
</p>

Anthropic prompt-cache observation, attribution, and forecasting —
how well your sessions are reusing provider-cached prefixes.

- **KPI tiles**: Cache ratio (cache_read ÷ cache_write tokens; the
  headline cache-payback signal), Cache read, Cache write, and
  Avoidable spend / Event count. The avoidable-spend tile is the
  dollar overhead of cache rewrites that wouldn't have happened on
  a perfectly cache-friendly session — it surfaces in warn tone when
  non-zero.
- **By model + By project tables** — for each rollup dimension: R%/W%
  mix bars + absolute Read / Write / Events + cache Ratio + Avoidable
  $. Identifies the model or repo that's pulling the most overhead.
- **Top causes histogram** — proportional bar list of `cache_events.cause`
  values. Healthy baseline is `suffix_growth` + `hit` dominating
  (info-toned warm prefix growth). Real invalidations (`system_changed`,
  `expiry_rewrite`, `model_switch_rewrite`) render in warn tone. Causes
  that legitimately fire on real operator toggles — currently
  `tools_changed` on MCP server connect/disconnect — render with a
  neutral "flagged" pill rather than alarm-red.
- **Worst sessions table** — ranked by rewrite count; click a row to
  open the session's Cache panel with the full per-turn timeline.

#### How the cache data gets captured

Two capture paths feed the same engine; both write the same three
local-only tables (`cache_segments`, `cache_entries`, `cache_events`;
migrations 036 + 037 — never pushed to a Teams org server, pinned by
`tests/invariant/privacy_test.go::TestSelectUnpushedSinceExcludesCacheTables`):

1. **Tier-1 (proxy)** — point your AI client at the local proxy
   (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820` for Claude Code;
   `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820/v1` for codex and
   copilot-cli). The proxy reads the upstream usage envelope
   (`cache_read_input_tokens` + `cache_creation_input_tokens`) and the
   cachetrack engine attributes each turn live as it streams. Every
   claude-code prompt-cache event surfaces here in real time.
2. **Tier-2 (transcript watcher)** — the watcher tails claude-code
   JSONL transcripts and feeds the same engine retroactively for
   sessions that didn't route through the proxy. Run
   `observer backfill --cache-rescan` to retrofit pre-cachetrack
   history.

#### How to enable / disable

- **Default-on.** Per spec §11, the loader merges `[cachetrack].enabled = true`
  if the section is absent. No action needed for a fresh install.
- To disable: set `[cachetrack].enabled = false` in
  `~/.observer/config.toml` and restart `observer start`.
- Inspect engine health: `observer cache-health --json` — §10 grading
  gate + read:write consistency + cause-concentration WARNs.
- 90-day retention is on by default
  (`[cachetrack].retention_days = 90`); the maintenance tick prunes
  stale `cache_*` rows alongside the existing retention pass.

### Suggestions tab

The **advisor** — a prescriptive suggestions engine that turns the
window's captured activity into ranked, dollar- or minute-quantified
recommendations. **On by default** and entirely local: detectors are
pure reads over data the observer already stores, recomputed fresh on
every view — zero LLM calls, zero network.

Twenty detectors across four categories:

- **cost** — session balloons (one session's context growth dominating
  spend), idle re-cache (cache rewrites after idle gaps), long-context
  tier crossings, trivial sessions on expensive models, cache hit-rate,
  cache-write waste, prefix thrash, read-heavy sessions on expensive
  models, effort overprovisioning, cross-session stale reads,
  web-search spend, spend spikes ("today is 3× your daily average" —
  the while-it's-still-happening check, linking to the Live view),
  routing evidence ready (the advise shadow met its promotion gate
  with routing still not enforcing — linking to the Shadow card,
  which owns the evidence and the consent-gated promote).
- **latency** — fast-tier premium (sessions that paid the 2× fast-tier
  rate without needing it).
- **quality** — unrecovered failures, quality regressions.
- **hygiene** — MCP schema overhead vs. actual MCP calls, compression
  off while proxied traffic flows, capture running without proxy
  routing, guard observing idle (recurring high-severity verdicts
  with zero approvals or tuning — linking to the Security page).

Each card carries the quantified claim ($ or minutes, with a
**show math** toggle exposing the arithmetic), a confidence score, a
scope chip (window / project / session — session scopes deep-link to
the session detail), and — when a dashboard control can fix the
finding — an action button that navigates to the right surface
(writes only ever happen behind that surface's own consent flow).
`snooze 7d` quiets a card temporarily; `dismiss` retires it, with a
7-day cooldown so the same finding doesn't re-nag. The all-clear
state means exactly what it says: nothing worth nagging about in
this window.

Tune it under Settings → Advisor (`[advisor]` in config.toml):
evidence window (default 14 days), confidence floor (0.5), minimum
claimed savings ($1), and the opt-in **session digest** — when
`session_digest = true`, the Claude Code session-start hook injects a
≤400-token digest of the top suggestions into new sessions (off by
default; the hook only reads a pre-computed snapshot, refreshed every
30 minutes). CLI twin: `observer advise`.

### Discovery tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/09-discovery.png" alt="Discovery tab" width="900">
</p>

Wasted-effort signals:

- **Stale rereads** — files re-read after they changed inside the
  same session. KPI tiles show count, ~Tokens wasted, ~$ wasted (at
  your blended input rate), affected files. The **CROSS-THREAD**
  column flags re-reads that crossed the parent ↔ sub-agent
  boundary — these are the "pass content via Agent's prompt
  parameter" candidates.
- **Repeated commands** — commands run multiple times with no
  relevant inputs changed in between (e.g. you ran `go test` three
  times without editing anything between runs).
- **Cross-tool overlap** — files touched by ≥2 AI clients in the
  window (e.g. claude-code AND cursor both edited `auth.ts`). This
  is the visible side of cross-platform tool-call sharing via the
  MCP server.

### Patterns tab

Repeatable behaviours the observer noticed across your sessions —
"after running `go test`, you almost always run `go vet`", "when
working on `auth.ts`, you also touch `login.tsx`", etc. Each pattern
has a confidence score (decay-weighted: more observations + recent
observations push it higher) and an observation count.

`observer patterns` derives them; `observer suggest` writes the
high-confidence ones into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules`
so new sessions inherit your habits.

### Security tab

The guard layer's operating surface — not just a verdict viewer.
Posture tiles (mode, verdict counts, audit-chain check) over a
filterable verdict timeline (rule / severity / decision / session,
with rule IDs resolved to their full definitions), then the routine
workflows end to end: a consent-gated **mode control** that shows the
simulate evidence before you flip enforce, the **enforce-readiness
card** (a replay of your real history under the enforce projection,
with per-rule blocking concentration), the **approvals register**
(scoped, expiring exceptions — DB writes, live immediately), a
**lint-gated policy editor** for your user rules (malformed files are
refused with the problems listed; `.bak` undo), **budget guardrails**
suggested from your own observed spend with a daily burn-down meter,
MCP pin approvals, and one-click **compliance evidence** downloads
(report / JSONL / CEF / audit verification).

### Routing tab

Model routing's transparency + adoption surface. While routing is
off, a **Preview savings** card replays your last 30 days under any
policy template — read-only, nothing enabled. Once advise mode runs,
the page shows the decisions feed (every decision expandable to its
matched rule, reason codes, and cache economics), savings with CI95
error bars, the expanded policy rule table (never a black box,
demoted rules marked), the tier map with calibration overlays, the
model health board, and the **advise-shadow readiness ladder** with
its consent-gated promote control. The **Apply to tools** card turns
observed sub-agent evidence into per-tool native config — dry-run
preview, one consent per file write, backups + per-file revert, and
an append-only audit ledger of everything observer changed.

### Settings tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/raw/main/docs/assets/screenshots/10-settings.png" alt="Settings tab" width="900">
</p>

Fully editable visual editor for everything in `config.toml`, plus
the operational panels a config file can't express:

- **Config sections** — schema-driven forms for Watcher, Freshness,
  Retention, Hooks, Proxy, Compression, Intelligence, Advisor, Cache
  tracking, Secrets scrubbing, MCP, Profiles, Org share, and OTel.
  Each section is honest about reload semantics: pricing and profile
  changes apply hot, MCP settings apply to the next AI session, and
  restart-gated sections raise a persistent restart-pending banner
  that names the exact command and clears itself only when the
  daemon actually restarts.
- **Connected tools** — one row per detected AI client (detected /
  capturing / hooks / MCP / proxied), a per-tool setup wizard that
  previews every config write and applies each one only on its own
  consent click, and a Launch button (with a copy-paste fallback)
  for opening a routed session.
- **Health** — the full `observer doctor` check set with remediation
  hints, plus recent command failures (recovered vs not).
- **Backfill** — every `observer backfill` mode as a click-to-run
  job with live streamed output, plus a full-rescan card with an
  adapter picker.
- **Storage** — what's actually taking the space: per-table database
  size breakdown (index and FTS5 shadow-table bytes folded into the
  table they serve), vacuum and online backup as click-to-run jobs,
  and the documented restore procedure (restore is deliberately
  manual: stop the daemon, swap the file, start). CLI twin:
  `observer db stats|vacuum|backup`.
- **Config file card** — view the active file; one-click restore of
  the automatic `.bak` taken before every save.

### Help drawer

Press `?` anywhere on the dashboard or click the **? Help** button in
the topbar. Every column header, KPI tile, chart label, and filter
control on every tab is annotated — hover any element to see a
one-liner tooltip; click to open the drawer at the matching glossary
entry.

The drawer has full descriptions, formulas, data sources, examples,
"why it matters", "what to do", and cross-links. Search at the top.
Deep-linkable via URL fragment — `#help/metric.stale_count` opens
the drawer at that entry.

Each compression mechanism (json / code / logs / text / diff / html
/ drop) has a "Full methodology · see more" expandable section
explaining the actual algorithm.


## MCP tools reference

Once you've run `observer init` (it's opt-in — `observer start`
alone does NOT register the MCP server), every connected AI client
gets these 13 tools registered as an MCP server — plus
`retrieve_stashed` when the proxy stash is configured. They're
**read-only** queries against the unified database, so any agent
can read any other agent's recorded work — true cross-platform
tool-call sharing.

| Tool                              | Purpose |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| `check_file_freshness`            | Has this file been read in the current session? Has it changed since? |
| `get_file_history`                | Full read/edit history of a file across all sessions and clients |
| `get_session_summary`             | Roll-up stats for a session: action count, success rate, cost, token buckets |
| `search_past_outputs`             | Full-text search across recorded tool outputs (FTS5-indexed) |
| `get_last_test_result`            | Most recent `go test` / `npm test` / `pytest` etc. output |
| `get_failure_context`             | Recent failures: which command, which file, which session |
| `get_action_details`              | One specific action's full record (target, args, output excerpt) |
| `check_command_freshness`         | Has this command been run in the current session? With what result? |
| `get_session_recovery_context`    | Recent activity for resuming a paused session |
| `get_project_patterns`            | High-confidence patterns derived from this project's history |
| `get_cost_summary`                | Daily / per-model / per-session cost rollups |
| `get_redundancy_report`           | Stale rereads, repeated commands, cross-tool overlap for the project |
| `list_actions_around`             | ±N actions adjacent to a pivot `action_id` — browse a session's local timeline cheaply |
| `retrieve_stashed` _(conditional)_| Pulls original bytes of a tool_result the proxy compressed away. Only registered when `[compression.conversation].stash` is configured. |

**Cost trade-off**: with the MCP registered, the AI client sends the
full tool-schema payload (~7.2 KB / ~1,800 tokens) in its system
context on every turn — whether or not the model actually invokes
any tool. To eliminate this overhead, run `observer init --skip-mcp`
(registers hooks only) or skip `init` entirely.

**Cross-tool sharing**: when `observer init` registers the MCP server
with Claude Code AND Cursor (and Codex…), all of them call the same
tools against the same database. Cursor's `get_last_test_result`
returns Claude Code's last test run; Codex's `check_file_freshness`
reflects edits made by Cursor.


## Compression mechanisms

The conversation-compression pipeline runs inside the proxy on every
upstream request. It tries to fit the request body within
`target_ratio × original_bytes` (default 0.85) without breaking the
conversation's referential integrity.

Two passes, in order:

### Pass 1 — per-content-type compression

Each `tool_result` block is sniffed for content type, then routed to
a content-aware compressor. Six compressors:

| Mechanism | What it does | When it fires |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **json**  | Replaces every scalar value with a type sentinel (`"<string>"`, `"<number>"`, …) preserving structure (keys, arrays, nesting). Arrays of length > 1 collapse to one element with `_len: N`. | API responses, structured logs, telemetry exports. JSON tool_results are usually the biggest savings target. |
| **code**  | Heuristic skeleton: keeps top-of-file imports + signature lines (function / method / class / struct / interface / type), drops bodies. | Source code files. **On by default** as of v1.7.23 in the `claude-code` profile (V7-24 empirical winner). |
| **logs**  | Two-pass: collapses adjacent identical lines to `<line> [×N]`, then head+tail-truncates to 200 lines if still long. | Log-shaped output — `go test ./...`, `npm run build`, polling/retry loops. Lossless on distinct lines; only the truncate pass is lossy. |
| **text**  | Catch-all for content not classified as code/json/logs/diff/html. Head+tail truncation: keeps 40 + 40 lines on inputs over 80 lines. | Markdown bodies, README excerpts, narrative descriptions. |
| **diff**  | Strips unified-diff context beyond ±1 line of each change. Keeps every header, every `+`/`-` line, drops the rest with elision markers. | `git diff`, patch tool outputs. Lossless on changes; lossy only on the cheap-to-rebuild context. |
| **html**  | Three regex passes: strips `<script>`, `<style>`, and HTML comments. Tag attributes + visible text + structural elements survive. | `web_fetch` results pulling whole HTML pages — usually 80%+ scripts/styles. |

### Pass 2 — drop with marker

If Pass 1's compressed body is still over budget, the budget enforcer
ranks remaining messages by **importance score** (a deterministic
weighted sum) and drops the lowest-scored non-preserved ones until
the budget is met. Each dropped message is replaced by a single
marker block (a placeholder text) so the conversation flow stays
intact for the model.

**Importance score** = `0.4 × recency + 0.3 × reference + 0.15 × density + 0.15 × role`

- **Recency** = `(i+1) / n` — newest message scores 1.0, oldest scores 1/n
- **Reference** = `1.0` if any of the message's `tool_use_ids` is
  cited by a later `tool_result`, OR any of its `referenced_ids` points
  to a live tool_use; `0.0` otherwise. Tool-pair-live messages always
  get full weight regardless of position.
- **Density** = fraction of non-whitespace runes (whitespace-padded
  outputs get dropped first)
- **Role** = `system 1.0`, `user 0.9`, `assistant 0.7`, `tool 0.5`
  (tool outputs are the most-compressible by policy)

**Preserved messages** (never droppable):
- The last `PreserveLastN` messages (default 4)
- Any `system` role message
- **Tool-pair-live messages**: any message whose `tool_use_id` is
  referenced by a later tool_result (parent side), AND any
  `tool_result` message whose `referenced_id` points to a live
  tool_use (consumer side)

Tool-pair preservation is symmetric — dropping either side leaves an
orphan that Anthropic rejects with 400.

### Per-event detail

Every drop and every per-type compression is recorded as a row in
the `compression_events` table (post migration 010). The Compression
tab's "Recent compression events" view surfaces these with
mechanism, original / compressed / saved bytes, message slot, and
importance score (for drops).

### Tuning — profiles pick the parameters for you

Compression parameters are supplied by **profiles**: named parameter
sets resolved per traffic class at the proxy boundary. The moment you
enable compression, Anthropic-path traffic gets the `claude-code`
profile and OpenAI-path traffic gets `codex-safe` — each tool gets
its tuned parameters simultaneously; there is no recipe-picking step.
Inspect with `observer profile list` / `observer profile show
<name>`; reassign per class or per tool (`observer profile assign
openai codex-variant`, `observer profile assign tool:kilo-code-cli
codex-safe`); build your own (`observer profile create mine --from
claude-code`, or Settings → Profiles in the dashboard). Per-tool
assignment needs the proxy to identify the connecting tool: hook-fed
identity (Claude Code) is exact, and Codex, Kilo CLI, opencode, and
Claude Code are also recognized by their request headers; clients
that send no distinctive headers (e.g. Cline CLI) fall back to the
per-provider profile. Profile
edits apply to **new sessions without a daemon restart**. A repo can
also carry `<root>/.observer/config.toml` with `[profiles]` /
`[compression]` keys to override per project — project files can turn
compression *off* for their traffic, never on.

The master config (`~/.observer/config.toml`) keeps the one on/off
switch and the fallback parameters used by the `default` profile:

```toml
[compression.conversation]
enabled = true             # THE switch — profiles never flip this
mode = "cache_aware"       # "token" | "cache" | "cache_aware" — default cache_aware; see matrix below
target_ratio = 0.85
preserve_last_n = 5        # never drop the most recent N messages
compress_types = ["json", "logs", "code"]   # default; add "text", "diff", "html" to opt in
```

High importance scores on dropped events (≥0.5) suggest the threshold
is too aggressive — raise `target_ratio` (e.g. 0.9 or 0.95).

### Choosing a mode: Anthropic vs Codex

Per-type `tool_result` compression runs in every mode; `mode` only changes how
messages are dropped and whether an Anthropic `cache_control` marker is injected.

| `mode` | What it does | Claude Code (Anthropic) | Codex / OpenAI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `token` | Per-type compress, then drop lowest-scored messages to hit `target_ratio`. | ✅ Works. | ✅ Clearest choice for Codex/OpenAI. |
| `cache` | Restrict drops to the tail half + inject a `cache_control` marker at the prefix boundary. | ✅ Anthropic-specific. | ⚠️ No effect beyond `token`. |
| `cache_aware` *(default)* | Skip drops, narrow compression to `tool_result` blocks, no marker; keep history byte-stable across turns so Anthropic's prefix cache keeps hitting. | ✅ **Recommended for Anthropic Pro/Max** — and the shipped default. | ⚠️ No effect beyond `token`. |

The shipped default is `cache_aware` (`token` is just the internal fallback when
`mode` is empty). The cache modes exist for **Anthropic's content-hash prefix
cache** (`cache_control` is an Anthropic Messages API concept). OpenAI/Codex
prompt caching is **automatic and server-side** — nothing to mark or tune, so
the proxy's OpenAI path is mode-agnostic (the default `cache_aware` behaves like
`token` there). So: keep `cache_aware` for Claude Code; `mode = "token"` reads
honestly for a Codex/OpenAI-only setup.

Beyond the keys above, three opt-in sub-features have their own tables —
`[compression.conversation.stash]` (Compressed-Content Retrieval),
`[compression.conversation.rolling]` (rolling summarisation, with a per-provider
summary model: `summary_model` for Anthropic, `openai_summary_model` for
OpenAI/Codex), and `[compression.conversation.compaction]`. The full knob
reference lives in `docs/compression-modes.md`.

### Measured savings (v1.7.23)

We A/B every shipped profile against an OFF baseline on a real refactor
workload (`lumen` TypeScript codebase, 408-line Zustand store →
4 domain sub-stores) on the v1.7.22 binary tip. The numbers below are
the **most recent statistically-meaningful measurements**.

The first two profiles are what the per-provider auto-assignment
applies (Anthropic → `claude-code`, OpenAI → `codex-safe`);
`codex-variant` is the manual pick for `-codex`-family models:

| Profile | Use when your model is… | Workload | n | Δ vs OFF (mean cost) | What's compressed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`claude-code`** *(default)* | Any Anthropic Claude model — `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-haiku-4-5`, … | Refactor, Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Claude Code 2.1.158 | n=8 B vs n=4 OFF | **−6.9%** (CV 7.6%; tighter than OFF's 7.5%) | json + logs + code bodies + tool-defs trim (A2-adopted 2026-06-11: −12.5% vs the pre-A2 set, zero `tools_changed` cache events); cache-aware; stash disabled |
| **`codex-variant`** | OpenAI's `-codex` reasoning fork — `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.4-codex`, `gpt-5-codex-agent`, anything matching `*-codex*` | Refactor, gpt-5.3-codex | n=10 B vs n=10 OFF | **−10%** ($0.270 vs $0.300) | Tools-defs trim; cache-aware; no per-type compression |
| **`codex-safe`** | Plain OpenAI GPT under the codex CLI — `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-4o`, any non-`-codex` | Refactor, gpt-5.4 + `apply_patch` | n=3 B vs n=4 OFF | not statistically distinguishable on this workload | logs + tools-defs trim (A6-adopted 2026-06-11: fired on 117/117 candidate requests, ~0.8KB/request of definition prose, task-completion parity + no cache degradation at n=9 vs n=7; effect scales with envelope bulk — MCP-registered installs save more); token mode |

The word **"variant"** in `codex-variant` refers to the *model variant* (the `-codex` reasoning fork of GPT), NOT a variant of the codex CLI. Both codex profiles are for the codex CLI; they differ only in which model family they assume. `codex-safe` is so named because plain GPT models tolerate logs trimming safely — it's not "safer than codex-variant."

**Honest caveats:**

- **Workload-dependent.** The `codex-safe` row on gpt-5.4 was
  inconclusive because the test workload used `apply_patch` (classified
  as `code`, not `logs`) so `compress_types=["logs"]` never fired —
  the proxy was a functional no-op and the cost variance was session
  noise. A Bash-heavy workload would tell a different story.
- **`claude-code` requires `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true`** in your shell.
  Without it, Claude Code's SDK disables ToolSearch under
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and eager-inlines all MCP schemas (~+21K
  tokens per turn). The proxy then becomes a net loss instead of
  the −6.9% above. Setup steps cover this; verify with
  `printenv ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH`.
- **`stash` stays disabled by default for Anthropic** (V7-25 finding:
  +25% cost on n=1 due to prefix-cache miss; stash markers break
  Anthropic's content-hash cache). Operators can opt in for a measured
  workload but should A/B their own.
- **Historic claims of higher savings are retracted.** The v1.4.38
  release notes cited −14.8%; the project itself walked that back
  after a deeper repro showed it was within noise. The numbers above
  are the post-retraction floor.

## Cost and token math

Anthropic's usage envelope reports four token buckets per request,
each at a different rate:

| Bucket             | What it is                                                                  | Bills at                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `net_input`        | Fresh prompt tokens not served from cache                                   | model's standard input rate |
| `cache_read`       | Prompt tokens served from Anthropic's ephemeral cache                       | ~10% of input rate          |
| `cache_creation`   | Tokens written to ephemeral cache                                            | 1.25× input (5m tier) or 2× input (1h tier) |
| `output`           | What the model generated                                                     | typically 5× input rate     |

`prompt_context = net_input + cache_read + cache_creation`
`total_tokens  = prompt_context + output`

The cost engine (`internal/intelligence/cost`) computes USD via:

```
cost_usd = (net_input × p.input + cache_read × p.cache_read +
            cache_creation_5m × p.cache_creation +
            cache_creation_1h × p.cache_creation_1h +
            output × p.output) ÷ 1,000,000
```

When the upstream API returns `cost_usd` in the response envelope
(proxy-sourced rows), that value is preferred over the computed one —
ground truth, reliability=high.

### Blended input rate

The Discovery tab's "~$ wasted" tile uses a **blended input rate**
computed from your last-30d api_turns mix: each model's input rate
weighted by the prompt-token volume it consumed. Example: if you
spent 70% of prompt tokens on opus-4-7 ($15/1M) and 30% on
haiku-4-5 ($1/1M), the blended rate is `0.7 × 15 + 0.3 × 1 = $10.80/1M`.

Falls back to $3/1M (claude-sonnet-4 input) on fresh installs with
no proxy data.

### JSONL dedup

When the proxy isn't engaged, observer falls back to parsing the AI
client's on-disk session log. Clients echo the same cumulative usage
on every content block of a multi-block response, so naive parsing
counts one API call 2-4×. Two layers of dedup catch this:

1. **Adapter-level**: dedupes on Anthropic `message.id` at write time
2. **Cost-engine-level**: dedupes on `(source_file, model, timestamp-bucketed-to-minute, tokens)` at read time

Migration 007 ran a one-time pass collapsing pre-fix duplicates.


## Security & control layer (guard)

The guard evaluates every captured agent action against a
table-driven policy — built-in rules (destructive commands, project
boundaries, secrets egress, MCP pinning, taint/dataflow, budgets)
plus your own TOML rules — records each verdict in a hash-chained,
tamper-evident audit table, and on the channels that support it can
block before execution. It ships **observe-only by default**: a fresh
install records and alerts, and never blocks anything until you
explicitly flip enforce.

What makes it different from standalone command-guards:

- **One policy, every tool.** The same rules evaluate Claude Code,
  Codex, Cursor, Cline and the rest through one engine — and
  `observer init --guard` additionally *compiles* the policy into
  each client's own native permission dialect, so the client itself
  enforces even when the observer daemon is down.
- **Replay before you enforce.** `observer guard simulate --since 168h`
  replays your real captured history against current policy and shows
  what last week WOULD have flagged or blocked — a confidence check
  only a tool that already has your history can run.
- **Proxy-level secrets egress scanning.** Clients routed through the
  observer proxy get outbound API bodies scanned for credentials,
  with mask/deny enforcement — an egress point no other local-first
  tool sits on.
- **Auditable, honestly.** Verdicts are hash-chained
  (tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof — the docs say exactly what that
  means), exportable as JSONL/CEF for your SIEM, and summarized by
  `observer guard report` into a compliance evidence pack mapped to
  SOC 2 / NIST 800-53.
- **Operable from the dashboard, not just the CLI.** The Security
  page runs the routine workflows end to end: a consent-gated mode
  control that shows the simulate evidence before you flip enforce,
  an Enforce-readiness replay over your real history, the approvals
  register (scoped, expiring exceptions — live immediately), a
  lint-gated policy editor for your user rules (malformed files are
  refused before they touch disk, with `.bak` undo), budget
  guardrails suggested from your own observed spend (p95 + headroom)
  with a daily burn-down meter, MCP pin approvals, and one-click
  compliance evidence downloads.

Honest scope: hooks see declared commands, not side effects (use OS
sandboxes for containment — the guard detects and recommends them);
most adapters are watcher-channel and can only flag post-hoc; the
proxy scan only covers proxy-routed clients. The full capability
matrix is on the dashboard's Security page, and the no-network
invariant holds — nothing leaves your machine unless you opt into
Teams push, OTel export, or the cloud alerting tier, each
individually.

Quick start:

```
observer guard status                  # mode, rules, recent verdicts, chain check
observer guard test "rm -rf ./build"  # would this block?
observer guard simulate --since 168h  # what would last week have flagged?
observer guard enable --enforce       # flip to enforce when ready
```

## Model routing

The routing layer selects the right model for each KIND of work —
from your own observed evidence, never a brochure — through two
channels: **A** writes each AI tool's own config (claude-code
per-subagent `model:` frontmatter — dry-run first, backed up,
revertable, audit-ledgered; other tools get exact paste-able
snippets), and **B** rewrites the `model` field on requests already
transiting the proxy. It is **opt-in, advise-first, and fail-open
everywhere**: a routing failure can never break a turn that would
have succeeded.

The adoption ladder is deliberate, and every step has a dashboard
surface: **preview** what a policy would have saved over your last 30
days while routing is still off (a read-only replay of recorded
turns) → enable **advise** (decision rows accrue; requests untouched)
→ read the **shadow** (the §R22 readiness ladder: enough decisions,
real net savings after cache forfeits, zero quality flags) →
**promote** to enforce through a consent dialog that restates the
evidence — and warns loudly when the gate is not met. Enforce
rewrites within the same provider shape only, holds switches that
would forfeit a warm prompt cache worth more than they save, and
auto-demotes any rule whose downshifts grade as regressing
(loudly, never silently). Custom `[[routing.rules]]` are editable in
a lint-gated dashboard editor with a worked recipe gallery in the
docs.

Privacy posture: decision rows and calibration are **node-local**
(never pushed to an org server); org-distributed policy fragments are
signed and structurally cannot flip your enforce switch — **no remote
enforce toggle exists, by design**.

Quick start:

```
# Preview before enabling anything (CLI twin of the dashboard card):
observer routing simulate --policy value --days 30
# Then: dashboard → Routing → Preview savings → Enable advise mode.
observer routing shadow    # the promotion evidence, any time
observer routing apply --tool claude-code   # Channel A, dry-run default
```

## Terminology and glossary

Quick reference; the in-platform help drawer (press `?` on the
dashboard) has the full versions with cross-links.

- **Action** — one normalized tool call recorded by an adapter. Action
  types are taxonomic and cross-client: `read_file`, `write_file`,
  `edit_file`, `run_command`, `search_text`, `search_files`,
  `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `mcp_call`, `spawn_subagent`,
  `todo_update`, `ask_user`, `task_complete`, `user_prompt`,
  `api_error`, `turn_aborted` (interrupted before completion —
  distinct from task_complete/success=false; v1.4.22+),
  `context_compacted` (upstream-emitted compaction marker, not
  searchable like file edits; v1.4.22+), `system_prompt`
  (system/developer/user-envelope content; v1.4.23+), `unknown`.
- **API turn** — one HTTP request captured by the local proxy. Records
  one row in `api_turns` per request, with the upstream usage envelope
  intact.
- **Cache 5m vs 1h tier** — Anthropic's prompt cache has two TTLs.
  Default is 5 minutes; `cache_control: {type: ephemeral, ttl: 3600}`
  extends to 1 hour at 2× the write cost. Reads bill the same rate
  regardless of tier.
- **Compression event** — one individual compression decision (one
  per-type compress, or one drop) recorded post migration 010.
- **Conversation compression** — pre-forward trimming of API request
  bodies. Pass 1 = per-content-type compression, Pass 2 = drop with
  marker. See [Compression mechanisms](#compression-mechanisms).
- **Cross-platform tool calling** — every AI client connected via
  `observer init` can call the 12 MCP tools against the unified
  database. So Cursor's `get_last_test_result` can return a `go test`
  Claude Code ran an hour earlier.
- **Cross-thread reread** — the parent thread re-reads a file the
  sub-agent already saw (or vice versa) within the same session. Fix:
  pass content via the Agent tool's `prompt` parameter rather than
  letting the child re-read.
- **Freshness state** — per-read tag from the freshness engine: `fresh`
  (first read in this session, OR re-read with same content),
  `stale` (re-read after change in same session), `missing` (file no
  longer exists), `modified-elsewhere` (file changed by something
  other than an observable AI action).
- **Mechanism** — one of `json`, `code`, `logs`, `text`, `diff`,
  `html` (per-content-type compressor) or `drop` (low-importance
  message replaced by a marker).
- **Pattern** — a derived behaviour: `command_pair` (X often
  followed by Y), `cross_tool_file` (file touched by multiple
  clients), `knowledge_snippet` (consistent topic-specific habit),
  `failure_correlation` (X often precedes a failure of Y),
  `session_summary`. Each has a decay-weighted confidence score 0-1.
- **Project** — working-directory root that owns sessions and
  actions. Derived from cwd at session start; `/.git/worktrees/...`
  paths fold back to the working-tree root.
- **Proxy vs JSONL** — proxy intercepts upstream HTTP calls (ground
  truth, reliability=high). JSONL parses the AI client's on-disk
  session log (works without configuring a base URL, but client
  echoes cumulative usage on every block, requiring dedup —
  reliability=unreliable for token counts on Claude Code).
- **Reliability** — cost-engine confidence: `high` (upstream-
  reported), `medium` (computed from known pricing), `low` (some
  buckets estimated), `unreliable` (no pricing entry).
- **Session** — one continuous AI-coding conversation in a single
  tool, scoped to one working directory. Has a stable ID (Claude
  Code's UUID, Codex's rollout ID, …).
- **Sidechain** — actions emitted inside a sub-agent runtime spawned
  via the parent's `Agent` tool. Sub-agents share the parent's
  session_id; the `is_sidechain` column distinguishes them. The
  Discovery tab's CROSS-THREAD column counts stale rereads that
  crossed this boundary.
- **Stale reread** — same-session re-read of a file whose content
  changed between reads. Cross-session reads are excluded (a fresh
  session has no memory of a prior session's read).
- **Tool** — in this dashboard, "tool" means the *AI client*
  (claude-code, cursor, codex, cline, cline-cli, copilot, copilot-cli,
  opencode, openclaw, pi, antigravity, gemini-cli, hermes, kilo-code,
  kilo-code-cli), not the per-tool name (`read_file`,
  `run_command`). The latter is "Tool name" on the Actions tab.
- **Tool-pair integrity** — Anthropic requires every `tool_result`
  block to have a corresponding `tool_use` block in a preceding
  message. The compression pipeline preserves both sides of every
  live pair to satisfy this constraint.


## CLI reference

Every command supports `--help` for the full surface.

| Subcommand                         | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| `observer init`                    | Register hooks + MCP server + durable proxy routes with installed AI clients (each side defaults on; opt out with `--skip-hooks` / `--skip-mcp` / `--skip-proxy-route`). With **zero flags on a terminal** it runs an interactive checklist instead: detects your tools, previews each pending config write, and asks consent one write at a time (MCP never pre-selected). Any flag or redirected stdio keeps the batch behaviour. |
| `observer uninstall`               | Reverse `observer init` |
| `observer start`                   | Run watcher + dashboard + proxy in one process (recommended). Auto-opens the dashboard on interactive launches. Flags: `--dashboard-addr ADDR` (default `127.0.0.1:8081`), `--no-dashboard` to skip the HTTP UI, `--no-open` to skip the browser. |
| `observer claude [-- args…]`       | Launch Claude Code routed through the proxy for that session only (no config writes; fresh Pro/Max OAuth token re-exported so the SDK can't bypass). `--verify` runs pre-flight checks without launching. |
| `observer codex [-- args…]`        | Launch Codex routed through the proxy for that session only (injects `openai_base_url` via argv; no config writes). |
| `observer watch`                   | Long-running JSONL watcher only |
| `observer dashboard --addr ADDR`   | HTTP dashboard only |
| `observer proxy start`             | Reverse proxy only |
| `observer scan`                    | One-shot ingest of existing JSONL files (catch-up after install) |
| `observer status`                  | DB stats + recent activity |
| `observer doctor`                  | Diagnostic — checks paths, schemas, hook registration |
| `observer tail`                    | Live tail of incoming events |
| `observer cost`                    | Per-model cost summary CLI |
| `observer score`                   | Compute quality_score / error_rate / redundancy_ratio for sessions |
| `observer discover`                | Stale rereads + repeated commands report (CLI version of the Discovery tab) |
| `observer patterns`                | Derive patterns from session history |
| `observer learn`                   | Adapter for ingesting external JSONL exports |
| `observer suggest`                 | Write high-confidence patterns into CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / .cursorrules |
| `observer summarize`               | Roll-up summary across sessions |
| `observer export`                  | Export DB to xlsx / json |
| `observer prune`                   | Manual retention pass (delete old data) |
| `observer db stats\|vacuum\|backup` | Storage manager. `stats`: per-table size breakdown (index + FTS5 shadow bytes folded into the table they serve). `vacuum`: reclaim free pages, reports bytes freed (can report SQLITE_BUSY against a busy daemon — re-run in a quiet moment). `backup <path>`: online snapshot via SQLite `VACUUM INTO` — safe while the daemon runs, refuses to overwrite. Restore is manual by design: stop daemon, swap file, start. |
| `observer db import <path>`        | Merge another `observer.db` into this node's (a stranded install from another OS or home directory). Set-based, single-transaction, idempotent — re-running adds nothing twice; project identities remap by root path. `--dry-run` executes the same transaction and rolls it back, so its per-table counts are exact. Migrates the source schema first — point it at a copy. Node-local state (cache tracking, watcher cursors, advisor state) doesn't transfer. |
| `observer backfill --is-sidechain` | Re-walk JSONL to populate `actions.is_sidechain` (added by migration 010) on pre-migration rows. |
| `observer backfill --cache-tier`   | Re-walk JSONL to populate `cache_creation_1h_tokens` (added by migration 008) on pre-migration rows. Run once after upgrading to v1.4.16+ to correct historical 1h-tier cache writes that were silently billed at the cheaper 5m rate. |
| `observer backfill --message-id`   | Re-walk JSONL to populate `message_id` on `actions` and `token_usage` (added by migration 012). Required by the per-message timeline view in the Sessions modal. |
| `observer backfill --all`          | Run every supported backfill in one invocation. Idempotent — safe to re-run. |
| `observer profile list\|show\|assign\|create\|delete\|set` | Compression profiles: inspect built-ins, reassign per traffic class or per tool (`assign tool:cline codex-safe`), create/edit custom profiles. Edits apply to new sessions hot. |
| `observer config set <key> <value>` | Dotted-key config setter (`compression.conversation.enabled true`). `--project <root>` writes a per-repo override file instead. |
| `observer advise`                  | Prescriptive cost/quality suggestions from captured activity (the Suggestions tab, in the CLI) |
| `observer cache-health`            | Prompt-cache engine health: grading gate, read:write consistency, cause concentration |
| `observer metrics`                 | Prometheus-format metrics endpoint |
| `observer serve`                   | MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC) — usually invoked by `observer init` registration |
| `observer completion <shell>`      | Generate shell completions (bash / zsh / fish / powershell) — e.g. `observer completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_observer"` |

## Troubleshooting

### `npm install -g` fails with `EACCES: permission denied`

Default npm puts globals under `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` which
Homebrew-managed Node owns as root on macOS. Three fixes; pick one:

```bash
# 1) RECOMMENDED — point npm at a user-writable prefix.
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
npm install -g @superbased/observer

# 2) Use a Node version manager — fnm / nvm install Node into your
#    home directory and dodge the permission issue entirely.
brew install fnm
fnm install --lts
npm install -g @superbased/observer

# 3) sudo (works but you'll fight permissions on every update).
sudo npm install -g @superbased/observer
```

### `observer: command not found` after install

The shim binary is at `~/.npm-global/bin/observer` (or wherever your
npm prefix points). Make sure that directory is on `$PATH`:

```bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep -E 'npm|node'
# add the prefix's bin/ to PATH if missing — see fix above
```

If you installed only a platform package (e.g. `@superbased/observer-darwin-x64`)
without the main `@superbased/observer`, the shim doesn't get created
— there's no `bin` field. Install the main package; npm picks up the
right platform binary automatically via `optionalDependencies`.

### `observer init` says "no tools selected and none auto-detected"

Auto-detection looks for the AI clients' default session-log dirs
(`~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.codex/sessions/`, `~/.cursor/`, etc.).
On a fresh machine where no client has run yet, those dirs don't
exist. Pass the flag explicitly:

```bash
observer init --claude-code     # or --codex / --cursor / --cline / --all
```

This registers hooks regardless — the next time the client runs,
its dirs get created and the watcher picks them up.

### Empty dashboard / "No proxy traffic"

Session/action data populates passively whenever `observer start` is
running, but ground-truth cost / compression numbers require the
proxy. Route your tool through it — the quickest way is the
dashboard's Compression tab → **Proxy** banner → **Route through the
observer proxy…** button; every other mechanism (wrappers, env vars,
`observer init`) is listed under
[Per-AI-client setup](#per-ai-client-setup).

Verify with `observer status | grep api_turns` — count should
climb during AI-client activity.

### `observer --version` says `dev`

You're on a non-released build. Reinstall with `npm install -g @superbased/observer` or rebuild with the workflow's `-X main.version=$VERSION` ldflag.

### `tool_result block must have a corresponding tool_use block`

Anthropic 400. Means the conversation-compression pipeline dropped
a `tool_use` while keeping its matching `tool_result`. Versions
prior to 1.3.2 had this bug; upgrade. If you're on 1.3.2+ and still
see it, file an issue with the conversation prefix.

### `tool use concurrency issues`

Anthropic 400 surfaced in Claude Code as this message. Means the
parallel-tool-use case (multiple `tool_use` blocks in one assistant
message) isn't paired correctly with the multi-block tool_result
that follows. Versions prior to 1.3.2 had this bug; upgrade.

### Cross-thread numbers are 0

Pre-migration data was ingested without the `is_sidechain` flag.
Run `observer backfill --is-sidechain` once to re-walk JSONL and
populate the flag on existing rows.

### Migration error: `duplicate column name`

Race condition between concurrent daemon startups, fixed in 1.4.1.
Upgrade. If you still see it, run daemons serially: `observer
watch`, wait, then `observer dashboard`, then `observer proxy
start` (or just use `observer start` which runs all three in one
process — proxy + watcher + dashboard).

### `observer start` log says only `proxy + observer` — no `:8081`

You're on a pre-1.4.7 build. Earlier versions ran only proxy +
watcher under `observer start`; the dashboard had to be started
separately via `observer dashboard --addr 127.0.0.1:8081`. Upgrade
to 1.4.7+ — the dashboard goroutine is now part of `observer start`
and the log line confirms all three: `proxy <addr> + watcher +
dashboard http://127.0.0.1:8081`. Pass `--no-dashboard` to opt out.

### "address already in use" on port 8820

Another `observer proxy start` or `observer start` is still running.
Find it with `pgrep -af 'observer (proxy|start)'` and `kill <pid>`.
On macOS:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:8820 -sTCP:LISTEN
kill <pid>
```

### Dashboard port already in use

```bash
observer dashboard --addr 127.0.0.1:8082    # pick a different port
# or
[dashboard]
port = 8082                                  # in config.toml
```


## Security and privacy

**Local-only. No telemetry. No remote anything.** The watcher, hook
handler, dashboard, MCP server, and CLI never make an outbound network
call on observer's behalf. The only code paths that touch the network
are the optional API proxy (which forwards **your** requests unchanged
to the AI provider you already use) and a handful of explicit opt-in
features (message-summary LLM, codegraph MCP, Teams org-server).

The full privacy statement — what observer stores, what it reads,
what it never stores, the explicit list of outbound-network call sites
gated behind config, and how to verify "no telemetry" yourself with
`grep`, `strings`, and a network-namespaced shell — lives in
[`PRIVACY.md`](https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).

Operational shorthand:

- **Local-only HTTP.** The proxy and dashboard bind to `127.0.0.1`
  by default. Don't bind to `0.0.0.0` unless you've thought about
  it — there's no auth.
- **Secrets scrubbing.** Tool inputs and outputs pass through
  `internal/scrub/` before persistence; review the regex set if your
  secrets follow non-default formats.
- **Database.** `~/.observer/observer.db` is a SQLite file with the
  same security posture as your `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` session
  logs (which already hold the same content). Encrypt the disk if
  your threat model needs that.
- **Full delete.** `rm -rf ~/.observer/` removes everything observer
  ever stored — no traces elsewhere on your system.
