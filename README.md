## What it is in 30 seconds

A single Go binary that sits **passively** alongside Claude Code,
Cursor, Codex, Cline, GitHub Copilot CLI, Copilot (VS Code),
OpenCode, OpenClaw, Pi, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, and Cowork
— parsing their session logs, optionally proxying their API calls
for accurate token counts, and exposing the result through a local
dashboard, an MCP server (so the tools themselves can query it),
and a CLI.

**Everything stays on your machine.** The observer never makes a
network call on its own; only the optional API proxy forwards your
requests to the upstream providers exactly as they came in.

It answers questions like:

- Where did this week's $147 Claude bill come from — which projects,
  models, sessions, tool calls?
- Did I spend more on Opus or Sonnet? Are my Sonnet sessions hitting
  the long-context tier and getting repriced at 2×?
- How much did I waste re-reading files that hadn't changed since
  the last read in the same session?
- Could that trivial Opus session have been done by Sonnet for 1/5
  the cost?
- Across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex working in the same repo,
  what files are touched by all three? Where are they stepping on
  each other?

## Install

### Via npm (recommended — pinned version, automatic platform binary)

```bash
npm install -g @superbased/observer
observer --version
```

### Via go install (latest main, builds locally)

```bash
go install github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/cmd/observer@latest
observer --version
```

### Via direct download (pre-built per-platform archive)

Each tagged release attaches per-platform archives to the
[Releases page](https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/releases),
verifiable against the published `SHA256SUMS`:

| Asset | Platform | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `observer-vX.Y.Z-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Linux x86_64 | `observer` + `antigravity-bridge.exe` (for WSL2) |
| `observer-vX.Y.Z-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | Linux arm64 | `observer` + `antigravity-bridge.exe` (for WSL2) |
| `observer-vX.Y.Z-darwin-x64.tar.gz` | macOS Intel | `observer` |
| `observer-vX.Y.Z-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` | macOS Apple Silicon | `observer` |
| `observer-vX.Y.Z-win32-x64.zip` | Windows x86_64 | `observer.exe` |
| `SHA256SUMS` | — | sha256 of all five archives |

```bash
# Linux x64 example — substitute your platform + version.
VERSION=v1.6.21
PLAT=linux-x64
curl -L -O https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/releases/download/$VERSION/observer-$VERSION-$PLAT.tar.gz
curl -L -O https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer/releases/download/$VERSION/SHA256SUMS
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
tar -xzf observer-$VERSION-$PLAT.tar.gz
./observer --version
```

The binary is pure Go — no CGO, no external runtime dependencies.
SQLite storage is pure-Go via `modernc.org/sqlite`. Single static
binary; `scp` it anywhere it runs. Same artifacts ship to npm and to
the Releases page (build-once-ship-everywhere CI), so the npm and
direct-download paths produce byte-identical binaries.

## First-run walkthrough

```bash
# 1. Register hooks + MCP entries with every detected AI tool.
#    Patches ~/.claude/settings.json, ~/.cursor/hooks.json,
#    ~/.claude.json, ~/.cursor/mcp.json, ~/.codex/config.toml.
observer init --all

# 2. Backfill from existing session logs so the dashboard has
#    history immediately rather than starting empty.
observer scan

# 3. Run proxy + watcher daemon + dashboard.
#    Foreground; ctrl-c to stop. Dashboard at http://localhost:8081.
observer start
```

**What each command does** — and what `start` alone does NOT do:

- `observer init` writes hook entries AND MCP server entries into each
  AI tool's own config files. Hooks default ON, MCP defaults ON; opt out
  per-side with `--skip-hooks` / `--skip-mcp`. Idempotent.
- `observer scan` is a one-shot historical backfill from existing
  session logs.
- `observer start` runs the API proxy, the live watcher, and the
  dashboard in one foreground process. **It also auto-registers
  hooks** for any detected AI tool that doesn't yet have them — so a
  user who skipped step 1 still gets live capture. **It does NOT
  register the MCP server** — MCP wiring is explicit-only, via
  `observer init`. If you don't want the MCP tools in your AI client,
  just never run `init`, or run `init --skip-mcp`.

For accurate token counts (rather than parsing whatever the JSONL
adapter could see) **and to enable conversation compression**, point
your AI tool at the proxy:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8820
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8820/v1
# Restart the AI tool — it'll route through the proxy from now on.
```

The proxy logs every turn with the exact token counts the provider
returned, including cache-tier breakdowns (5m vs 1h ephemeral) and
1h surcharges that JSONL adapters can't always disambiguate.

### Verifying the install

```bash
observer doctor          # health checks: DB integrity, hook
                         # registration, MCP entries, pid bridge
observer status          # row counts + recent activity
observer tail            # live-stream captured actions
```

---

## Dashboard tour

Open <http://localhost:8081> after `observer start`. Ten tabs, each
designed around one question.

### Overview — what's been happening?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/01-overview.png" alt="Overview tab" width="900">
</p>

Four headline KPI tiles (sessions, API turns, token rows, stale
re-reads — each filterable by the global Window / Tool / Project
chips), cost-over-time stacked area split by billable token bucket,
actions-over-time stacked by tool, top models by token volume, top
tools by action count.

### Sessions — what did each run actually do?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/02-sessions.png" alt="Sessions tab" width="900">
</p>

One row per session with cost, token totals (input / cache R /
cache W / output), elapsed time, action count, and a model badge.
Quality / Errors / Redundancy scoring columns light up once
`observer score` has run. Click a row to open the per-session
slide-over (shown below in [Session detail](#session-detail--drill-into-one-session)).

### Actions — the firehose, filtered

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/03-actions.png" alt="Actions tab" width="900">
</p>

Every recorded tool call, normalized across adapters. Filter by
action type (28 categories), tool, effort, permission. Each row
exposes its `target` + status + raw-tool source + truncated content
preview; click to expand to the full event with error context.

### Cost — per-model breakdown with the right math

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/04-cost.png" alt="Cost tab" width="900">
</p>

Eight KPI tiles across the billable token buckets (Net Input, Cache
Read, Cache Write 5m, Cache Write 1h, Output, Reasoning, plus total
USD and turn count). Per-model table shows the full breakdown
including reasoning tokens (billed at output rate) and long-context
surcharges (Sonnet 1M, gpt-5 >272K, Gemini 2.5 Pro >200K). Hover
any column header for its definition + formula.

### Analysis — spending insights & efficiency signals

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/05-analysis.png" alt="Analysis tab" width="900">
</p>

Twelve KPI tiles comparing this period to prior: spend Δ%, MTD vs
budget with projection bar, $/M output rate, cache savings + cache
efficacy %, high-context turn count, $/turn, burn rate ($/active
hour), top model concentration %, Discovery waste $, sessions
total. Daily-spend stacked bars with Model / Project / Tool
dimension toggle, hour-of-day heatmap, period-over-period movers
(top increases / decreases / new entrants), and routing-efficiency
suggestions (trivial Opus sessions that could have used Sonnet).

### Tools — per-AI-client breakdown

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/06-tools.png" alt="Tools tab" width="900">
</p>

Four KPIs (total actions, distinct tools, overall success rate,
busiest tool), activity-over-time stacked area, and per-tool
action-type-mix horizontal bars (100% normalized, colored by action
category). Surfaces which AI client owned which kind of work.

### Compression — what the proxy saved

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/07-compression.png" alt="Compression tab" width="900">
</p>

Five KPIs: total $ saved (priced at your input rate), tokens saved,
bytes trimmed, turns compressed. Savings-per-day stacked bar by
mechanism (drop, trim, summary), savings-by-mechanism donut, recent
events table with original→compressed→saved + dollar impact per
event.

### Discovery — the waste detector

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/08-discovery.png" alt="Discovery tab" width="900">
</p>

Waste $ hero (stale-read tokens × your blended input rate). Four
KPIs: stale re-reads count, tokens wasted, affected files, repeated
commands. Top files re-read table with cross-thread highlighting
(when the same file was re-read from a subagent that didn't see the
parent's read). Repeated-commands table with no-change-rerun
detection.

### Settings — every config knob, editable

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/09-settings.png" alt="Settings tab" width="900">
</p>

Pricing overrides hot-reload (no daemon restart — `cost.Engine`
swaps the pricing table atomically). 156 baked-in default models;
"Override" prompts auto-fill from the default. Backfill mode panel
spawns `observer backfill` as a child process with live output
streamed back. Watcher / Freshness / Retention / Hooks / Proxy /
Compression / Intelligence sections are schema-driven forms with
inline help. Restart-required banner appears when a section is
saved that the daemon binds at startup.

### Session detail — drill into one session

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/screenshots/10-session-detail.png" alt="Session detail slide-over panel" width="900">
</p>

Click any session row → slide-over with action-type breakdown
donut, token-bucket bar (input / cache R / cache W / output),
per-message timeline showing every upstream API turn with model,
tokens, cost, and the tool calls inside it. Same panel surfaces
from Actions when clicking a session pill.

## MCP server — 13 cross-tool intelligence calls

**Opt-in.** The MCP server is not active until you run
`observer init` (or `observer init --claude-code` / `--cursor` /
`--codex`). That command writes entries pointing at the observer
binary into each AI tool's own MCP config file
(`~/.claude.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`).
The MCP server then runs as a **stdio subprocess spawned by your AI
tool** — its lifecycle matches the AI tool's, and it never opens a
network port. `observer start` alone does NOT register or launch
the MCP server; it can be skipped entirely via
`observer init --skip-mcp` if you want hooks-only capture.

Once registered, every connected AI tool can query the observer
over MCP/stdio:

| MCP tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `check_file_freshness` | Has this file changed since I last read it? |
| `get_file_history` | Every read/edit of this file across every tool + session (with codegraph enrichment when available). |
| `get_session_summary` | What did session X actually do? AI-generated 2–4 sentence summaries. |
| `search_past_outputs` | Full-text search of past tool-call outputs (FTS5 over excerpts). |
| `check_command_freshness` | Did this exact command already run? With what result? |
| `get_session_recovery_context` | For resuming an interrupted session. |
| `get_project_patterns` | Derived behaviours: hot files, co-changes, edit→test pairs. |
| `get_last_test_result` | Without re-running. |
| `get_failure_context` | Error correlation + retry detection. |
| `get_action_details` | The raw row, scrubbed of secrets. |
| `get_cost_summary` | Per-window spend rollup. |
| `get_redundancy_report` | What would Discovery flag for this project? |
| `list_actions_around` | Chronological ±N actions around an `action_id`. |
| `retrieve_stashed` _(conditional)_ | Pulls original bytes of a tool_result the proxy stashed (only registered when CCR is enabled). |

Knowledge captured from one tool benefits all the others working on
the same project — data is organized by git root, not by tool. A
read by Claude Code becomes a freshness signal for Codex; a Cursor
compaction is visible from Cline.

## API proxy — accurate tokens, compression, stash

The proxy is the home of three features that only exist when your AI
client routes through it. None of them run on the watcher / `observer
start` ingestion path — compression and stash live in the request
path because that's the only place where bytes can be rewritten
before they reach the upstream provider.

When you point your AI tool at `http://localhost:8820`, the proxy:

1. **Forwards your request to your chosen upstream** (Anthropic or
   OpenAI). The destination is the same provider URL your AI client
   would have called directly; no data leaves your machine that
   wasn't already going to that provider. Your API key is yours —
   the proxy reads it from the inflight headers, never stores it.
2. **Records the exact token counts** the provider returned (cache
   5m vs 1h split, long-context tier triggers, reasoning tokens)
   into the `api_turns` table — more accurate than parsing the
   JSONL the AI tool wrote.
3. **Optionally compresses the conversation** before forwarding
   (importance-scored, prefix-stable for cache alignment) — the
   biggest lever for keeping long sessions inside rate-limit
   windows. Off by default; opt in via
   `[compression.conversation].enabled = true`. Compressed events
   land in the `compression_events` table and surface on the
   Compression dashboard tab.
4. **Stashes large tool outputs** the compressor hides, so the
   originals stay retrievable via the `retrieve_stashed` MCP tool
   (which is only registered when stash is configured).

Three compression layers, each independently toggleable:

- **Shell output filters** — RTK-style truncation of large `bash` /
  `git` / `go test` / `docker` / `kubectl` / `cargo` / `pytest`
  outputs inline before they hit the LLM context. Runs on hook /
  `observer run` paths; does not require the proxy.
- **Tool output indexing** — every tool call's output indexed into
  FTS5; large outputs trimmed to a 2KB excerpt cap so the index
  stays compact and `search_past_outputs` stays fast. Runs on the
  watcher path; does not require the proxy.
- **Conversation compression** — proxy rewrites large `tool_result`
  blocks before forwarding upstream. **Proxy-only** — there is no
  non-proxy path for this layer, and the stash that backs
  `retrieve_stashed` is wired here too.

**Trade-off if you skip the proxy:** you still get full hook + JSONL
ingestion, the dashboard, MCP (if registered), and shell+indexing
compression. You lose proxy-grade token accuracy, conversation
compression, and the stash. For rate-limited plans (Claude Teams 5h/7d
windows), conversation compression is usually the difference between
"finishes the task" and "hits the limit."

### Choosing a compression mode (Anthropic vs Codex)

`[compression.conversation].mode` behaves differently per provider. Per-type
`tool_result` compression runs in every mode; `mode` only changes how messages
are dropped and whether an Anthropic `cache_control` marker is injected.

| `mode` | What it does | Claude Code (Anthropic) | Codex / OpenAI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `token` | Per-type compress, then drop lowest-scored messages to hit `target_ratio`. | ✅ Works. | ✅ Clearest choice for Codex/OpenAI. |
| `cache` | Restrict drops to the tail half + inject a `cache_control` marker at the prefix boundary. | ✅ Anthropic-specific. | ⚠️ No effect beyond `token`. |
| `cache_aware` *(default)* | Skip drops, narrow compression to `tool_result` blocks, no marker injection; keep history byte-stable across turns so Anthropic's prefix cache keeps hitting (`cache_creation` falls on later turns). | ✅ **Recommended for Anthropic Pro/Max** — and the shipped default. | ⚠️ No effect beyond `token`, so the default is harmless for Codex. |

The shipped default is `cache_aware` (`token` is just the internal fallback when
`mode` is empty). The `cache`/`cache_aware` strategies exist for **Anthropic's
content-hash prefix cache** (`cache_control` is an Anthropic Messages API
concept). OpenAI/Codex prompt caching is **automatic and server-side** — there
is nothing to mark or tune, so the proxy's OpenAI path is mode-agnostic (the
default `cache_aware` simply behaves like `token` there). Recipes:

```toml
# Claude Code (Anthropic Pro/Max) — recommended for 5h/7d rate windows
[compression.conversation]
enabled = true
mode = "cache_aware"
```

```toml
# Codex / OpenAI — cache modes would no-op; server-side caching is automatic
[compression.conversation]
enabled = true
mode = "token"
```

Then point your client at the proxy — `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820`
(Claude Code) or `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8820/v1` (Codex) — and
restart it. Full knob reference (stash, rolling-summary's per-provider model
split, compaction): [`docs/compression-modes.md`](docs/compression-modes.md).

                                          upstream API
                                          (traffic passes

                                           + optional compression)
```

Adapters parse each platform's session format into a unified
`Action` row. The cost engine reads `api_turns` (proxy, accurate)
and `token_usage` (JSONL adapters, approximate) and deduplicates
per-turn via the upstream `request_id` ↔ `source_event_id` match.
The MCP server exposes the same database. The dashboard pulls JSON
from the same `/api/*` endpoints the MCP tools use.

---

## Teams & Org Visibility

For teams, an optional **`observer-org`** server gives admins org-wide
visibility — per-developer and per-team spend, project rollups, and budgets —
without changing the solo-local experience at all. It is purely additive: a
developer who never enrols sees a byte-identical local tool. Developers opt in
with `observer enroll <org-url> <token>`, after which the agent pushes
**content-free** rollup rows (signed, gzipped, deduplicated) to the server.
Authentication is SAML SSO for humans, SCIM 2.0 for provisioning, and Ed25519
bearers for agents; no prompts, command bodies, or file contents ever leave the
machine. The server ships as a signed Docker image
(`ghcr.io/marmutapp/observer-org`) and a Helm chart (`charts/observer-org/`).

Independently, each agent can export per-turn LLM spans to your own
OpenTelemetry collector (`gen_ai.*` + `sbo.*` attributes, off by default).

- **[Getting started](docs/teams-getting-started.md)** — install the server,
  wire up SAML/SCIM, enrol your first agent, verify data flows.
- **[Architecture](docs/teams-architecture.md)** — components, runtime data
  flow, the security and privacy model, source map.
- **[Operations](docs/teams-operations.md)** — backup/restore, key rotation,
  upgrades, troubleshooting.

Every key has a TOML environment-variable override:
`OBSERVER_<SECTION>_<KEY>` (uppercased, underscores). Nested
sections join with extra underscores:
`OBSERVER_COMPRESSION_CONVERSATION_ENABLED=true`.

The Settings tab in the dashboard provides a fully-editable
visual editor for everything in `config.toml` — pricing
hot-reloads; other sections require a daemon restart (one-click
via the banner that appears after save).

## Post-upgrade hygiene + recovery

After upgrading the binary, or whenever the Actions tab looks
gappy (watcher fell behind, daemon restart with stale state,
fsnotify event drops):

```bash
observer backfill --all
```

Re-walks every JSONL the adapters know about from offset 0, then
runs the surgical column-update backfills (cache-tier, message-id,
etc.) on top. The `(source_file, source_event_id)` UNIQUE index
keeps the pass idempotent.

The dashboard surfaces a top-of-page banner whenever the watcher's
parse cursor for any session file is more than 10 KB behind the
on-disk size, so silent data loss has a visible signal.
`observer backfill --help` lists every supported flag.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marmutapp/superbased-observer
cd superbased-observer
make build        # builds bin/observer + bin/antigravity-bridge.exe
make test         # full test suite (race detector enabled)
make all          # fmt + vet + lint + test + build
```

Requirements: **Go 1.22+**. No CGO. SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`
(pure Go). golangci-lint optional for `make lint`. Dashboard
source under `web/` (React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind); the
compiled bundle is committed to
`internal/intelligence/dashboard/webapp/dist/` so a contributor
who only touches Go can `make build` without Node.

If you edit `web/src/`:

```bash
# Hot-reload dev loop (Vite serves :5173, proxies /api/* to observer)
./bin/observer dashboard --addr 127.0.0.1:8081 &
cd web && npm install && npm run dev

# When done, rebuild the embedded bundle and commit
make web-build
git add internal/intelligence/dashboard/webapp/dist web/dist
```

`make web-build` regenerates both `web/dist` and the embedded copy.
Requires **Node 22 LTS**.

### CI gates

Every PR + push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- **`frontend`** — `npm ci` → typecheck → build → dist-consistency
  check (asserts the committed embedded bundle matches a fresh build).
- **`go`** — `go vet` → `go test -race` → cross-compile.

Tag pushes (`v*`) trigger `.github/workflows/npm-release.yml`:
builds the frontend once, cross-compiles five platform binaries,
ships them to npm, and creates a GitHub Release.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Table-driven tests in every package; >80% coverage on
core packages (cost, freshness, adapters, store). Run `make test`
before submitting; `make all` locally to catch fmt/vet/lint issues.
Conventional commits (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` /
`test:` / `refactor:` / `perf:`).

For larger changes, open an issue first to align on scope. Adapter
contributions (a new AI coding tool to support) are particularly
welcome — see existing adapters in `internal/adapter/` for the
pattern.
