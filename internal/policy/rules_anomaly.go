// Anomaly rules (spec §5.7, §12.2). G12 ships A-610 (stuck-loop
// detection over the guard layer's consecutive-identical-action
// tracker). A-611 (MAD z-score rate anomaly vs per-project baselines)
// and A-612 (first-ever-seen action-type novelty) need the
// per-project baseline plumbing in internal/intelligence and are
// deferred with reason — recorded in the spec §22 tracker, never
// silently stubbed.
//
// Anomaly NEVER denies (§12.2, the F6 principle: statistical signals
// don't get enforcement authority) — A-610 is flag in both modes.

// repeatLoopThreshold is the A-610 consecutive-identical run length
// past which the row fires: the 9th identical action in a row flags.
// The value is deliberately above common legitimate retry counts
// (formatters re-run 2-3×, flaky-test retries 3-5×); a tool that
// legitimately repeats more is tuned via [guard.rules] disable or a
// user rule with repeat_count_gt (§4.4).

// CROSSING event (RepeatCount == threshold+1), not on every repeat
// after it — a 50-iteration loop is one finding, not 42. A new
// episode (the run resets, then repeats again) fires again. User
// repeat_count_gt matchers use strict-greater semantics instead and
// re-match each repeat — their decision, documented in the matcher
// reference.
