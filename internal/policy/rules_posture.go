// Posture rules (spec §5.4, §13) — risky client-configuration states.
// G11 ships R-204 (native deny-rule drift, the §13.2 compile moat's
// detection half); G13 ships R-205 as the integrity-failure row, its
// first signal being an org policy bundle that failed signature/pin
// verification (§14.2 — the §5.4 hook-integrity signal joins the same
// row as another finding kind when that machinery promotes to guard
// events). R-201/R-202/R-203 stay unbuilt until their posture signals
// exist as data (session metadata capture for yolo flags and sandbox
// state) — recorded in the spec §22 tracker, never silently stubbed.
//
// R-204 follows the MCPFindings evaluation shape exactly: the drift
// computation lives at the owner (the cmd-layer dialect runner, which
// holds the compiled-entry tables via internal/guard/compile and the
// pin state via the store) and is stamped onto a KindConfigChange
// event as a PostureFinding. This package only matches on the stamped
// finding — it never reads native client configs itself (§17.1
// purity). The row is flag-in-both-modes: the drift scan observes
// config state after the fact, so there is nothing to block; the
// remediation surface is `observer guard compile`.

// PostureFinding kind vocabulary (PostureFinding.Kind values). Stable
// strings — they appear in verdict reasons and tests.
